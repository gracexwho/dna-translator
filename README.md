# dna-translator
Translates provided DNA sequences into amino acid sequences or returns the reverse complement.

If the DNA sequence provided belongs to the leading strand, the reverse complement (the 5' to 3' orientation of the lagging strand)
will be returned if the user asks for a reverse complement.

Also returns the amino acid sequence (based off the 64 codon table, including Amber, Ochre, Opal stop codons) of either the
forward translation (the sequence provided) or the reverse translation (the reverse complement of the sequence).

For all those primer sequencing needs
